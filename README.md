# Object detection system using Detectron2 algorithm and Audi A2D2 dataset
Object detection system that can be used for autonomous vehicles

For this project, I use Detectron2 from Facebook (https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) to train and test data
from Audi (https://www.a2d2.audi/a2d2/en.html). For citations have a look on my thesis.

Due to the required GPU capacities, this project is done by a Google-Colab notebook so that the training and testing of the model can be outsourced to a Amazon AWS Server. The notebook is based on the example notebook from Facebook's Detectron2 (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16jcaJoc6bCFAQ96jDe2HwtXj7BMD_-m5).
